                    <h4>Mac Miller's Music Career</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mac Miller was born in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania on January 19, 1992 as Malcolm James McCormick. Mac Miller's rapping 
                        career took of early as his highschool friends started posting videos of a young Malcolm freestyling. These videos gave 
                        him the exposre he need to get the ball rolling. Shortly after the videos emerged, in 2010, Mac Miller dropped his a mixtape (which has
                        now been remastered into an album) called "K.I.D.S." K.I.D.S" was a hit and included hit tracks like "Nikes On My Feet" and "Kood-Aid and Frozen Pizza."
                        This album was followed shortly by another album called "Blue Slide Park," which had hit tracks like "Frick Park Market." Both
                        albums had a fun, upbeat, let's get this party started vibe to them. But now lets fast forward three years later in 2013 when Mac dropped "Watching Movies
                        with the Sound Off."  (Which in my personal favorite album he dropped).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When "Watching Movie with the Sound Off" was released it was a controversial album for his fandom because Mac was known for that "fun" sound
                        and with this album he changed that entire persona. It was the first time Mac got philisophical on his music and spoke about things deeper 
                        than just having a good time. This albums was filled clever word play, witty metaphors, and challenging views. Some of top tracks from this album
                        include "I Am Who Am (Killin' Time)," "The Star Room," "Objects in the Mirror," and "Red Dot Music." A year later in 2014 Mac Miller brought another controversial project to the 
                        table and the project was a mixtape called "Faces."   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Faces" is arguably the best project Mac Miller has ever released... mixtape or album. "Faces" took Mac's drug addiction and painted a picture with it so 
                        we could all feel his pain and so we could realize we are not the only ones going though things like despression, anxiety and lonliness. He spoke on topics like 
                        romance, religion, depression, and abstract ideas. Some must-check-out tracks on the mixtape are "Diablo," "Wedding," "Shapes and Colors," and "Angel Dust." 
                        Mac did not stop there another year later Mac dropped another album called "Good A.M.." Some hit songs on this album are "Perfect Circle" and "Cut the Check."
                        In this album Mac was detoxing from his drug addiction so the sound he brought was once again different. This is phase three of Mac.

                    <p>
                        After "Good A.M." came Mac Miller changed his style yet again and started making Jazz Music alongside rap. You can hear these sounds in his albums "The Divine
                        Femenist") 2016, "Swimming" (2018), and his last album "Circles" (2020). To check out the songs I have mentioned here check out the bar to the right of this
